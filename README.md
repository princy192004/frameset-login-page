So I have created a frameset,in the frame set I have inserted some fields like timetable, login forms , admission forms ,etc.. so when I click the login form link ,it takes me to the main page, then after entering the correct fields as asked ,it pops as login success otherwise it shows an error to enter the felids correctly .So when i click the other field like timteab,it displays the timetable in the main page ,then when i click the imagema,i have dine the image mapping concept,when i touch specific place it leads me to another page ,then when i click admission form it diapit in main page where i creteusing css and html ,so these felids i have made in the frameset concept ,i covered all the feilds in this concept
